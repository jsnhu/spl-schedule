# spl-schedule

An NSP-like real-world application of linear optimization used in Summer 2017 for the Squamish Public Library as part of a final project in Linear Algebra. The original project has been heavily modified for usability and updatability. The current project now uses an Excel/JuMP system. Full write-up available soon at jsnhu.github.io.
